# Compose Browser - a simple web browser

This is a very basic web browser built using Compose for desktop.
It cannot display complex HTML, just basic documents, roughly the set
of HTML elements that you can expect from rendering markdown documents to
HTML.

To run the browser, execute this:

    ./gradlew pinpitRun
